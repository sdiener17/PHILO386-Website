    text1:"The word pirate likely makes you think of characters like Jack Sparrow and Blackbeard, but modern day pirates look completely different. The internet has made it easy for users to illegally download music, video games, movies, and other items for free. This is called piracy but with it being essentially free to create copies virtual copies of items, it’s up for debate whether or not this should be a crime.",
    text2: "In the magazine article “Piracy: Does it Matter?” Adam Coster advises video game developers on if combating piracy in/of their games is worth it. According to Coster a large majority of users are pirates. He also claims that most pirates would prefer to not have the content at all instead of paying for it, and the percent of their revenue that was from pirates who were caught was less than 5% of their revenue, and therefore it didn’t make financial sense to put money into combatting pirates. Coster does give a few cheap/easy ways to combat pirates, but suggests that putting effort into completely combat pirates is not cost effective (especially for single player games where pirates don’t directly affect other users), and the current methods employed to catch pirates are also not effective (Coster). There are some flaws in Coster’s arguments. His sample size only consists of a game he created, meaning his game could just be an outlier. Also his game was not a game backed by a major corporation, and isn’t a “big-name” title, so his experience might not be the same experience as a game such as a Call of Duty game, created by a large corporation with a “big-name” title.",
    text3: "Coster's article also doesn’t account for the piracy with older games and console games. For instance pirating a game no longer in production like Pokémon Crystal, which is now a collectors item, where a copy of the game created by Nintendo (the games creator) can cost thousands of dollars (eBay). Someone wanting to play Pokémon Crystal might be a situation in which pirating a copy would be ethical, because the game has been discontinued, so the creators are no longer profiting on the game selling, and the legal method of purchasing the game has a far greater cost then the original selling cost of the game. Pokémon has multiple interesting situations like this where piracy might be ethical. See the questionnaire section of this website to ponder these situations.",
    text4: "Between 1975 and 1999 music record sales grew from $5.8 billion to $12.8 billion. Between 2000 and 2008 it fell back down to $5.5 million. This can likely be attributed to the rise in the ease of pirating music brought about by computers and the internet (Waldfogel). Now in the age of streaming, where anyone can stream basically any song with a $10 Spotify Premium subscription (or free with ads) it seems significantly less ethical to illegally download a song when the ability to listen to any song legally and in a way that at least somewhat benefits the creator is widely available and very affordable (or free in some cases)."
