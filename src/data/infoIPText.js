    text1: "Intellectual property Dates back to 500 B.C.E when chefs were granted yearly rights to exclusively cook particular dishes. Past that while there are no known written laws protecting intellectual property, there is evidence of poets being disgraced for stealing words and phrases from other poets. There is also evidence of cases where Roman jurists discussed ownership of intellectual work, like paintings (Moore and Himma).",
    text2: "The three current largest sets of laws that protect intellectual property are patents, trademarks, and copyright. The first set of laws is patents. Patent laws protect anything related to the invention or discovery of new processes, machines, articles of manufacture or composition of matter. The second set of laws,Trademark laws protect the good will and good names of companies. The final set of laws is copyright law which applies to any tangible medium of expression. This includes movies, music, photographs, and literary work. It also includes software (Moore and Himma).",
    text3: "For something to be eligible to be protected by copyright laws it has to be an original on the author. The copyrighted item must also be non-utilitarian (non-functional). Items that are utilitarian (useful/functional) fit under copyright law. Copyright owners get the exclusive right to reproduce their work. They have the exclusive rights to adapt/derive their work, distribute copies of their work, display and perform their work publically (Moore and Himma).",
