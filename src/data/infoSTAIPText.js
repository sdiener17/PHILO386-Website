    text1: "Due to the fact that software can be recreated essentially for free it raises the question if software should be free. Free software by itself is an undefined concept which creates problems. For instance, does software give you free access to the code where you can modify it, or does it just give you access to use the code? For the purposes of this website free software is software, anyone can use, see, and modify (Stallman).",
    text2: "Richard Stallman advocates for all software to be free in his essay, “Why Software Should be Free.” People who argue that software should be free say restricting the use of software has harmful effects like less people using the code, no one else can modify or adapt the code, and other developers cannot learn from the program or base new codes on the program. One of the main counterpoints to why software should be free is that by removing software copyright, you reduce the incentive for developers to create new code. In his essay, Stallman attempts to counter this argument, writing that writing software is fun, and that alone is enough motivation to create new software, and developers do not need an artificial incentive like money to be motivated to create new software. Stallman also points out that the creation of new software benefits hardware companies, so if software is made free, Stallman thinks hardware companies will financially back software developers (Stallman).",
    text3: "Stallman is aware that if software is fee, even if hardware companies financially back software designers there likely will be less programmers, but he believes that the decrease in programmers will be more then replaced by several effects if making software free. This first reason is that if anyone can modify the program, each program would be able to be modified to have more uses. Also existing programs could be customized instead of starting from scratch, and it would eliminate the effort currently going toward different companies developing the same code, saving programmers time. Also if anyone can see any current code, programmers would be better trained and able to create better programs (Stallman).",
    text4: "Stallman believes that if software is made free, then hardware companies will financially back programmers, since hardware companies need software to exist to give their products use. However if this happens it’s possible that the hardware companies will require that the software only works on their machines. For instance if Dell were to financially back a software company, they could create their hardware or software in such a way that their software doesn’t work without Dell hardware. While software developers at Hewlett-Packard would have access to modify the software, the developers at Dell could make it complicated enough where it would take a reasonable amount of time for Hewlett-Packard to make the software compatible with their hardware. This would create a much worse experience for users, and wouldn’t be the first time companies would create a compatibility issue with their products. Microsoft and Sony have created version exclusive games, like Halo, Spider-man, and God of War, for their respective consoles. Apple also has a history of infringing on users' right to repair, discouraging users from using their competitors hardware to repair their Apple devices. This behavior suggests that large corporations wouldn’t hesitate to put effort in to make things harder on their competition."
